# CS_F214_Logic_Assignment_1
This assignment was given in BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus.
In this assignment we were asked to prove the completeness thoerem. I did the assignment in a hurry since I was sick. I forgot to assemble the proofs.
Question:  Check if the following semantic entailment holds

p → q |= ¬p ∨ q

If the semantic entailment holds then construct a proof of the corresponding sequent mimicking the steps of the Completeness Theorem.
